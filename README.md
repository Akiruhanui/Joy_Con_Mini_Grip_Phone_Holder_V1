# Joy_Con_Mini_Grip_Phone_Holder_V1
Covers a small joy con grip and attaches to a phone grip which uses standard camera gear threading (most likely 1/4-20 UNC). Smallest bolts on the esign are M3, but can also use 1/8 in. Medium sized bolts (for attaching the hinges together) are M5, and the largest metric bolt is an M6, which attaches at the bottom of the grip.
